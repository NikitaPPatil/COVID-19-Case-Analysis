**COVID-19 Case Analysis**<br>
**Project Overview**<br>
This project focuses on reinforcing the concepts of time series data handling using COVID-19 daily confirmed cases data. The tasks include loading, indexing, visualizing data, generating date ranges, resampling, shifting, and applying moving window functions. This exercise aims to build a comprehensive understanding of time series data manipulation and analysis.

**Objectives**<br>
Load and visualize COVID-19 daily confirmed cases data.<br>
Generate date ranges and create a DataFrame with simulated daily temperatures.<br>
Resample data and convert frequencies.<br>
Shift time series data.<br>
Compute rolling statistics and apply moving window functions.<br>

**Learnings**<br>
Through this project, the following concepts were reinforced:<br>
Understanding the fundamentals of time series data.<br>
Generating date ranges and working with different frequencies.<br>
Resampling data and converting frequencies.<br>
Shifting time series data.<br>
Computing rolling statistics and applying moving window functions.<br>

**Visualizations**<br>
The project includes various visualizations to aid in understanding the time series data manipulations:<br>
Daily New Cases Visualization: Original daily COVID-19 new cases.<br>
Weekly Resampled Data: Sum of new cases resampled to a weekly frequency.<br>
Shifted Data Visualization: COVID-19 data shifted forward by 7 days.<br>
Moving Average Visualization: 7-day moving average of new cases alongside the original data.<br>

**Conclusion**<br>
This project demonstrates the effective handling and analysis of time series data, showcasing skills in loading, indexing, generating date ranges, resampling, shifting, and applying moving window functions. The practical application of these techniques on COVID-19 data provides valuable insights and a solid foundation for further time series analysis projects.
